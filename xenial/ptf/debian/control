 # Introduction
 .
 PTF is a Python based dataplane test framework. It is based on unittest, which
 is included in the standard Python distribution.
 .
 This document is meant to provide an introduction to the framework, discuss the
 basics of running tests and to provide examples of how to add tests.
 .
 Most of the code was taken from the [OFTest
 framework](https://github.com/floodlight/oftest). However, PTF focuses on the
 dataplane and is independent of OpenFlow. We also added several
 [new features](#New-features).
